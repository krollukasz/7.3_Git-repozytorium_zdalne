                <p>Lost in the middle of a jungle<br>
                    Sending an SOS to the world<br>
                    Lonely on an island<br>
                    In the middle of the sea<br><br>
                    
                    I hear a stranger's voice around me<br>
                    A savage woman looks to my eyes<br>
                    But I know this, baby<br>
                    She's the woman of<br><br>
                    
                    And I fall in love with her<br>
                    To follow in paradise<br>
                    She's the kind of girl I love<br>
                    She's the girl of my dreams<br><br>
                    
                    But tonight arrives and she<br>
                    Goes so far away from me<br>
                    I don't know where she sits by<br>
                    Please don't go from my side<br><br>
                    
                    Chorus:<br> 
                    Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh<br>
                    I will miss you forever<br>
                    Bye bye mi amor - my baby<br>
                    Don't you leave me tonight<br>
                    Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh<br>
                    I will miss you forever<br>
                    Bye bye mi amor - my baby<br>
                    Don't you leave me tonight<br><br>
                </p>
		<p>I don't know if I am only dreaming
		   But I'm dreming really surprised
		   Now I can believe it
		   But she's in front of me

		   I hear a stranger's voice around me
		   A savage woman looks to my eyes
		   But I know this, baby
		   She's the woman of Tarzan

		   And I fall in love with her
		   To follow in paradise
		   She's the kind of girl I love
		   She's the girl of my dreams

		   But tonight arrives and she
		   Goes so far away from me
		   I don't know where she sits by
		   Please don't go from my side

		   Chorus: 
		   Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh
		   I will miss you forever
		   Bye bye mi amor - my baby
		   Don't you leave me tonight
		   Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh
		   I will miss you forever
		   Bye bye mi amor - my baby
		   Don't you leave me tonight
