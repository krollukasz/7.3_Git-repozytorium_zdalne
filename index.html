                    Sending an SOS to the world<br>
                    Lonely on an island<br>
                    In the middle of the sea<br><br>
                    
                    I hear a stranger's voice around me<br>
                    A savage woman looks to my eyes<br>
                    But I know this, baby<br>
                    She's the woman of<br><br>
                    
                    And I fall in love with her<br>
